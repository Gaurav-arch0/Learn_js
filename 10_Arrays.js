// Javascript arrays are resizeable.
// When we do array copy operation , the new copy is a reference to the original data. This is known as Shallow Copy.
// Shallow Copy -  copy of an object whose properties share the same reference point.
// Deep Copy - copy of an object whose properties do not share the same reference point.

const array1 = [1,2,3,4];
